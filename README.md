# Synthetic Bank Statement Generator

This project generates **synthetic bank statements** to support innovation in financial data processing while preserving the privacy of real account holders. Synthetic data mimics the structure and patterns of real bank statements without exposing sensitive information, making it ideal for learning, development, and testing in controlled environments.

**Important**: The synthetic data generated by this project is strictly for **learning and development purposes** and must not be used for any other purposes, including fraudulent activities or real-world financial applications.

## Why Synthetic Bank Statements?
- **Privacy Protection**: Enables developers to work with realistic financial data without risking exposure of sensitive information.
- **Innovation**: Supports the development of financial tools, machine learning models, and data processing pipelines.
- **Flexibility**: Generates diverse, customizable datasets for various use cases in a controlled, ethical manner.

## Project Objectives

This project is structured around three key challenges in generating high-quality synthetic bank statements:

1. **Leveraging LLMs for Realistic Descriptions** (Version 1)  
   Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate realistic transaction descriptions that mimic real-world banking patterns (e.g., "Grocery Store Purchase - Whole Foods" or "ATM Withdrawal - Main St") enhancing the authenticity of synthetic data.

2. **Formatting for Realism** (Version 2)  
   The output is formatted to closely resemble real bank statements, including layout, fonts, and structure. Version 2 aim to mimic structural elements of actual bank statements.

3. **Streamlining Diverse Data Generation** (Version 3)  
   To capture a wide range of banking scenarios, this version incorporates a variety of bank statements and logos to increase the realism of the synthetic bank statements.

## Current Pipeline

The synthetic bank statement generation process follows these steps:

1. **Data and Template Extraction**  
   - **Tool**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) (e.g., Tesseract).  
   - **Process**: Sample bank statements (anonymized or template-based) are processed to extract layout, formatting, and data fields (e.g., account number, transaction dates, amounts).  
   - **Challenges**: Handling varied statement formats and ensuring accurate extraction of complex layouts.

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - **Tools**: Large Language Model (e.g. mistral:7b-instruct-v0.3-q4_0) and Faker library.  
   - **Process**: LLMs generate realistic transaction descriptions, while Faker creates synthetic data for fields like names, account numbers, and addresses.  
   - **Challenges**: Ensuring diversity in generated data and avoiding repetitive or unrealistic patterns.

3. **Output Formatting**  
   - **Tool**: PDF generation library (e.g., ReportLab).  
   - **Process**: Synthetic data is combined with extracted templates to produce PDF bank statements that mimic real-world formats.  
   - **Challenges**: Matching fonts, alignments, and visual elements of real statements.
