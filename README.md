The goal of this project is to produce synthetic bank statements.

Each version answers questions related to sythetic data.

Version1: How can we leverage LLM's to generate descriptions in synthetic data?

Version2: How do we format the output to look similar to the real deal?

Version3: How can we streamline the process of producing synthetic data to capture a diverse set of reference data?

Current pipeline: Sample statements have their data and template extracted with OCR -> LLM and Faker generate fake data -> PDF
